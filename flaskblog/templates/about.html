    <h1>About Flask</h1>
    <p>Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.</p>
    <p>Flask gives you the tools to build web applications quickly and with less code than some other frameworks. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, Flask makes it easy to create web applications.</p>

    <h2>Key Features</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Micro: Flask is a lightweight framework with minimal built-in components, allowing you to choose your preferred extensions and libraries.</li>
        <li>Extensible: You can easily add extensions to Flask to enhance its functionality, such as Flask-SQLAlchemy for database support or Flask-WTF for form handling.</li>
        <li>Widely Adopted: Flask is widely used in the Python community and has a large and active user base, which means you can find plenty of resources and support.</li>
        <li>RESTful: Flask is well-suited for building RESTful APIs, making it a popular choice for web services and APIs.</li>
        <li>Community: Flask has a strong and active community, which contributes to its continued growth and improvement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started</h2>
    <p>If you're new to Flask, you can start by installing it and creating your first Flask application. The official Flask documentation provides step-by-step guides and examples to help you get started.</p>

    <h2>1. Flask-SQLAlchemy</h2>
    <p>Flask-SQLAlchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy, a popular Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library. With this module, you can easily work with databases and perform operations like creating, querying, and updating database records.</p>

    <h2>2. Flask-WTF</h2>
    <p>Flask-WTF is an integration of the WTForms library with Flask. It simplifies form creation and handling in Flask applications. You can use this module to validate and process form data, making it ideal for building web forms.</p>

    <h2>3. Flask-RESTful</h2>
    <p>Flask-RESTful is an extension for building RESTful APIs using Flask. It simplifies the creation of API endpoints, request parsing, and resource management. If you're building web services or APIs, this module is a valuable tool.</p>

    <h2>4. Flask-Login</h2>
    <p>Flask-Login provides session management and user authentication for Flask applications. It allows you to handle user logins, logouts, and session persistence easily. This module is essential for building web applications with user accounts.</p>

    <h2>5. Flask-Mail</h2>
    <p>Flask-Mail simplifies email sending in Flask applications. It supports sending plain text and HTML emails, attachments, and email configuration. This module is useful for sending notifications and user emails.</p>

    <h2>6. Flask-RESTPlus</h2>
    <p>Flask-RESTPlus is an extension for building RESTful APIs with additional features like Swagger documentation. It makes API development more accessible and user-friendly by providing automatic API documentation.</p>

    <h2>7. Flask-Security</h2>
    <p>Flask-Security is an extension that adds more advanced security features to Flask applications. It includes features like role management, token-based authentication, and password hashing.</p>

    <h2>8. Flask-CORS</h2>
    <p>Flask-CORS is used for handling Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) in Flask applications. It allows you to control which domains can access your API, making it essential for building secure web services.</p>

    <h2>Learn More</h2>
    <p>To explore these modules and their usage in more detail, you can refer to the Flask documentation and the documentation for each individual extension. Additionally, the Flask community and forums are excellent resources for learning and getting support.</p>
